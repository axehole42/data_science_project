\section{Introduction}
This document records the reasoning, methodology, and progress of our data science project. The primary goal is to predict whether a firm will report positive or negative net income in the next fiscal year ($t+1$) based on financial data from the current year ($t$).

\section{Research Question}
\textbf{Question:} Can we predict whether a firm will report positive or negative net income next year ($t+1$) using current-year ($t$) financial ratios and features?

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target Variable:} Binary classification. 1 if Net Income Adjusted (\texttt{niadj}) $> 0$, else 0.
    \item \textbf{Scope:} Compustat data (North America), 2014--2024.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Cleaning and Preprocessing}
\subsection{Initial Inspection}
The raw dataset contains financial indicators identified by \texttt{gvkey} (company) and \texttt{fyear} (fiscal year).

\subsection{Cleaning Steps}
To ensure data quality and relevance, the following filtering steps are applied sequentially:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Standard Compustat Filters:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Industry Format (\texttt{indfmt}):} Kept only 'INDL' (Industrial) to exclude financial services which have different accounting structures.
        \item \textbf{Data Format (\texttt{datafmt}):} Kept only 'STD' (Standardized) for consistency.
        \item \textbf{Population Source (\texttt{popsrc}):} Kept only 'D' (Domestic/US) to focus the scope.
        \item \textbf{Consolidation Level (\texttt{consol}):} Kept only 'C' (Consolidated) to avoid double-counting via parent companies.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Missing and Zero Values Filter:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rows with missing or zero \textbf{Total Assets (\texttt{at})} are dropped. Assets must be strictly positive to serve as a denominator for financial ratios (preventing division by zero).
        \item Rows with missing \textbf{Net Income Adjusted (\texttt{niadj})} are dropped. Note that \textbf{negative values of \texttt{niadj} are retained}, as predicting negative income is the core objective.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Duplicate Removal:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sorted by \texttt{gvkey} and \texttt{fyear}.
        \item Dropped duplicates, keeping the most recent update based on \texttt{datadate}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Type Standardization:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Converted mixed-type columns (e.g., prices with commas) to proper numeric formats.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
